This an easy to use unity package that allows you to test your material's Luma reactivity directly into unity 

(as well as audiolink)


It is simply using the Audio Link avatar testing prefab and LumaDriver in a preconfigured way so that they work together :)


All credits goes to the 2 original creators of these prefabs.
I only repackaged and configured them so that it's easy and just a drag and drop to add it into your projects.
